## This is a generated custom data file.
## The samples here are designed to show you how to use this file properly.
## Messing with item metadata can be tricky, but can also make your kits and items seem much more polished.
##
## PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:
##
## 1) To insert a line break in a book, use the sequence '|n' (vertical slash + 'n').
## 2) For custom items, the 'item' field is parsed with the same syntax as in kits.
## 3) For custom items, %player% is a text macro that will be automatically replaced by the name of the player receiving the item.
## 4) Bursts are sub-components of fireworks that contain color data and such.  A firework can contain multiple bursts.
## 5) Burst type can be one of: BALL, BALL_LARGE, BURST, STAR, or CREEPER.
## 6) Burst colors are represented by numbers in hexadecimal.  To look up hexadecimal codes, visit http://html-color-codes.com/.  Hexadecimal color codes MUST BE PREFIXED BY '0x'.
## 7) Firework bursts are all the bursts that should display when the firework explodes.
